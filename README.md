# papas-burgeria-ai

This is a Papa's Burgeria Auto player thing, in the sense of automatic condiments clicker to make a 94% mayo burger for example. I will be adding much more features as time goes on. Feel free to change and play with my code. I have made the program according to the flash game on cool math games (www.coolmath-games.com/0-papas-burgeria). This is programmed in python, and required pyautogui to run. This is currently programmed to run on 15 inch 1080p screens with no guarantee that it'll work.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Ensure that the flash game is open in the background
2. Run Python program and quickly switch to the browser
3. Enjoy the Mayo!
4. When done or an error has occured cover the Mayo bottle, weather that be closing the browser or press Ctrl + C to stop the Python program.
